# Kepler-438b
Kepler-438b orbit 2d animation (processing programming language)
This is an introductory example for the exoplanet project (remember to create HTML image maps including, stars, exoplanet and other objects of your zodiac constellation).
In this 2D example it is indicated the red dwarf star Kepler-438 located in Lyra at 470 light years from us. The radius of the planet Kepler-438b is 1.12 times Earth radius, the radius of the star Kepler-438 is 0.52 times the Sun radius and the distance is 0.166 times the Earth (0.166 AU). Rotation period only 35.23 days. Sun radius equals 110 times Earth radius. Earth similary index ESI = 0.88.
Try to scale radius of exoplanets and stars, distances and rotation period. Exoplanet is 10 times smaller in the animation.
